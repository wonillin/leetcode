You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!  

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.  

**Input Format**

The following tables contain contest data:

* Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.
